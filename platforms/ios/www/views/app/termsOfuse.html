  <li>Greet Telehealth (OPC) Private Limited. (“DoctorQuick”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) operates the website located at www.doctorquick.com and mobile application with links to these Terms of Use (collectively, the “Site”). We offer online telehealth services (the “Services”) enabling our members (“Members”) to report their health history and engage healthcare professionals (“Treating Providers”) to obtain medical and healthcare services (“Services”). By accessing and using the Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and all other terms and policies that appear on the Site. If you do not wish to be bound by any of these Terms of Use, you may not use the Site or the Services.</li>

  <li>Healthcare Services. All of the Treating Providers who deliver Services through DoctorQuick are independent professionals solely responsible for the services each provides to you. DoctorQuick does not practice medicine or any other licensed profession, and does not interfere with the practice of medicine or any other licensed profession by Treating Providers, each of whom is responsible for his or her services and compliance with the requirements applicable to his or her profession and license. Neither DoctorQuick nor any third parties who promote the Services or provide you with a link to the Service shall be liable for any professional advice you obtain from a Treating Provider via the Services.</li>

  <li>Site Content. None of the Site content (other than information you receive from Treating Providers) should be considered medical advice or an endorsement, representation or warranty that any particular medication or treatment is safe, appropriate, or effective for you.</li>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Informed Consent</strong></p>

  <ol>
      <li>Telehealth is the delivery of health care services using interactive audio and video technology, where the patient and the health care professional are not in the same physical location. During your telehealth consultation with a Treating Provider, details of your medical or health history and personal health information may be discussed with you through the use of interactive video, audio and other telecommunications technology, and your Treating Provider may perform a physical examination through these technologies. Depending on your medical or health history and/or specific complaint, you may be asked to provide information through biometric devices such as digital thermometers or blood pressure cuffs.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The telehealth Services you receive from Treating Providers are not intended to replace a primary care physician relationship or be your permanent medical home. You should seek emergency help or follow-up care when recommended by a Treating Provider or when otherwise needed, and continue to consult with your primary care physician and other healthcare professionals as recommended. You will have direct access to customer support services to follow up on medication reactions, side effects or other adverse events. Among the benefits of our Services are improved access to healthcare professionals and convenience. However, as with any medical or health service, there are potential risks associated with the use of telehealth. These risks include, but may not be limited to:</li>
  </ol>

  <p>In rare cases, information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate medical or health care decision making by the Treating Provider;<br />
  Delays in evaluation or treatment could occur due to failures of the electronic equipment;<br />
  In rare cases, a lack of access to all of your medical records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors;<br />
  Although the electronic systems we use will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the privacy and security of health information, in rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal health information</p>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>By accepting these Terms of Use, you acknowledge that you understand and agree with the following:</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You understand that you may expect the anticipated benefits from the use of telehealth in your care, but that no results can be guaranteed or assured.<br />
  You understand that the laws that protect the privacy and security of health information apply to telehealth, and have received DoctorQuick’s Notice of Privacy Practices, which describes these protections in more detail.<br />
  If your health insurance coverage does not include or is not sufficient to satisfy the Services charges in full, you may be fully or partially responsible for payment.<br />
  Your Treating Provider may determine that the Services are not appropriate for some or all of your treatment needs, and accordingly may elect not to provide telehealth services to you through the Site in your Treating Provider’s sole discretion.</p>
